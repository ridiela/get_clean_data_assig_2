** this dataset contains the mean value for each pair subjct_value VS columm

*** "subjects": a number designing one distinct subject in the experiment
*** "value": a description of the activity the subject did

*** The rest of the dataset is structured as follows:

* Fields starting with "t" make reference to time-domain signals
* Fields starting with "f" make reference to  frequency-fomain signas, obtained after an fft transformation
* Rest of the features, those starting with angle, are averages in a signal window sample.
* Accelerometer and Gyroscope name values extracet from those sensors
* XYZ name axis of accelerometr and Syroscope

*** Feature Labels
